give me a detailed step by step approach to integrate the opensrs reseller ssl  api for the sw_register (trust_service)endpoint to wordpress , either through the WPGetAPI or with custom plugin
using the documentation https://domains.opensrs.guide/docs/sw_register-trust_service




client is a reseller of ssl
Client wants me to integrate an api that will do the enrollment process of a product purchase on opensrs on the client's account.

so basically the client has funds on his opensrs account, and 


opensrs has its own prices of the product that the client is selling ,so when the client's customers come to his site they will see the prices of the ssl that the client has set, which is different from what opensrs has sold the ssl product to my client. 

so basically opensrs will handle the enrollment or purchases, but the prices is what the client will have set .


these are the business requirement of the api integration.

Scenario:
 - I am a reseller of opensrs ssl certs, I want to reseller these cert on my wordpress website, so I can control the prices. 
 - User who comes to my site ,when they click an ssl cert product, it'll take them to the page
   that has detail for that product, these details will come from opensrs through an api endpoint that returns product/cert information based on a product ID

- If the user decides to purchase that prodcut/ssl cert , then the sw_register (trust_service) – Used for product enrollment and purchase, will handle the process
  user will need to provide relevant informtion needed by this endpoint to successfully purchase the product 

-  So  on the products page catalog when user selects a product a call must be to opensrs to get that products informaion and prepolate the 
   sw_register for with that products name/ID 

-  So in summary The API integration is for the product page , on each products page we need to make calls to the api to get products information
   and ready the purchase form


Key Requirements:
- Sync WooCommerce products with OpenSRS (matching product IDs).  
- Implement API calls for product details, purchase (`sw_register`), and order management.  
- Use shortcodes for enrollment forms.  
- Follow best practices: efficient, reusable, scalable.  
- Use VS Code—show folder structure & packaging.
- Wire better and good Comment to the code for better understanding
- The wp setting must take only the API Username and API Key 
- Provide testing steps.  
- Refer to [OpenSRS API Docs](https://domains.opensrs.guide/docs)**, focusing on **SSL Service Commands
- Follow the below folder structure

To develop a WordPress plugin that integrates with the OpenSRS Trust Service API, capturing the specified user inputs, and following an Agile methodology with incremental development and testing, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Plugin Structure**:
   - **Create Plugin Files**:
     - Establish the main plugin file (`opensrs-trust-service.php`).
     - Create subdirectories:
       - `assets/`: For CSS and JavaScript files.
       - `includes/`: For PHP classes and functions.
       - `templates/`: For form templates.
   - **Define Plugin Header**:
     - In `opensrs-trust-service.php`, include the standard WordPress plugin header with details like Name, URI, Description, Version, Author, and License.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Unit Test**: Verify that the plugin header is correctly defined and that the plugin file is recognized by WordPress.
   - **Integration Test**: Ensure that the plugin activates without errors in a clean WordPress environment.

2. **Implement the Shortcode**:
   - **Create Shortcode Function**:
     - Develop a function to render the registration form.
   - **Register Shortcode**:
     - Use `add_shortcode()` to make the form accessible via a shortcode.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Unit Test**: Check that the shortcode function returns the expected form HTML.
   - **Integration Test**: Place the shortcode in a WordPress page and verify that the form displays correctly.

3. **Develop the Registration Form Template**:
   - **Design Form Template**:
     - In `templates/form-template.php`, create a form that captures:
       - **CSR**: A text input field for the Certificate Signing Request.
       - **Domain Name**: A text input field for the domain name.
       - **Contact Information**: Text input fields for first name, last name, address1, address2, address3, city, postal code, state, country, phone, fax, and email.
       - **Registration Period**: A hidden input field pre-populated with the value `1`.
       - **Product Type**: A hidden input field pre-populated with the product type.
       - **Name**: A hidden input field pre-populated with the name.
       - **Registration Type**: A dropdown menu with options: `new`, `renew`, and `upgrade`.
   - **Apply CSS Styling**:
     - Use CSS to ensure the form is user-friendly and visually appealing.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Unit Test**: Ensure that the form template includes all necessary fields with correct attributes.
   - **Integration Test**: Render the form in a page and verify that all fields are present and styled correctly.

4. **Handle Form Submission**:
   - **Validate Inputs**:
     - Ensure all form inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - **Process Submission**:
     - Upon form submission, process the data and prepare it for API interaction.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Unit Test**: Test the validation functions with various input scenarios to ensure they handle edge cases.
   - **Integration Test**: Submit the form with valid and invalid data and verify that the appropriate responses are returned.

5. **Integrate with OpenSRS Trust Service API**:
   - **Configure API Settings**:
     - Allow the admin to input API credentials, select test/live mode, and set the API URL via WordPress settings.
   - **Implement API Communication**:
     - Develop functions to send requests to the OpenSRS API, handle responses, and manage errors.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Unit Test**: Mock API responses to test the handling of different scenarios.
   - **Integration Test**: Use a staging API environment to test real interactions and ensure correct data handling.

6. **Ensure Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Organize Code**:
     - Maintain modularity by separating concerns into appropriate files and classes.
   - **Follow WordPress Coding Standards**:
     - Adhere to best practices for readability and maintainability.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Code Review**: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to standards and identify potential issues.

7. **Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
   - **Set Up Testing Environment**:
     - Configure PHPUnit for testing.
   - **Write Unit Tests**:
     - Develop tests for individual functions and methods to ensure they perform as expected.
   - **Conduct Integration Tests**:
     - Test the interaction between components, especially the form submission and API communication.
   - **Perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
     - Validate the plugin's functionality from an end-user perspective.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing into the development workflow to catch issues early.

8. **Provide Uninstall Functionality**:
   - **Create Uninstall Script**:
     - In `uninstall.php`, include code to clean up settings and data upon plugin removal.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **Integration Test**: Install and uninstall the plugin to ensure that all data is properly cleaned up.

9. **Document the Plugin**:
   - **Write Documentation**:
     - Provide clear instructions on installation, configuration, and usage.
   - **Include Inline Comments**:
     - Ensure code is well-commented for future developers.

   *Testing Opportunity*:
   - **User Testing**: Have users follow the documentation to set up and use the plugin, identifying any ambiguities or missing information.

10. **Test and Debug**:
    - **Debugging**:
      - Use debugging tools to identify and fix issues.
    - **Cross-Browser Testing**:
      - Ensure the form functions correctly across different browsers.
    - **Performance Testing**:
      - Assess the plugin's performance to ensure it doesn't negatively impact site speed.

    *Testing Opportunity*:
    - **Performance Profiling**: Use tools to monitor the plugin's impact on site performance and optimize as needed 



Test : https://horizon.opensrs.net:55443
Live : https://rr-n1-tor.opensrs.net:55443



now read the https://domains.opensrs.guide/docs/sw_register-trust_service and implement that api with the above code.

provide the user with a form to enter the requested detail by the api.

provide a shortcode for usage. 




Construction of the POST Data
Suggest Edits
The header for the POST data should have the following format. Replace the items in brackets with user- and command-specific information.

POST data

POST / HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: text/xml
X-Username: (OpenSRS Username)
X-Signature: (MD5 Signature)
Content-Length: (Length of XML Document)


consider M5 signature generation , handle this in the code. use the provided OpenSRS reseller username as part of the header information.


replace the sandbox with test_environment.
when user selects test_environment the API Endpoint URL must be https://horizon.opensrs.net:55443 
and https://rr-n1-tor.opensrs.net:55443 for production
